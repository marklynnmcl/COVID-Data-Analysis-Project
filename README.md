In this project, I analyzed global COVID-19 trends using SQL and developed a Tableau dashboard to visualize the insights. I worked with a dataset containing information about COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations across various countries and continents. Through advanced SQL techniques such as Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Window Functions, and Aggregate Functions, I calculated key metrics like population infection rates, likelihood of death upon infection, and vaccination percentages.

To present the findings, I designed a Tableau dashboard showcasing global and regional trends, including total cases and deaths, death rates per continent, and infection rates by population. You can find my Tableau profile here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mark.mclaughlin3601/vizzes
